# Evolution in progress! Change of finches beaks over 'observable' time.

The Darwin's finches dataset we'll be using is easily one of the most exciting in science, because you can observe what many have called real-time evolution or ["evolution ocurring before our eyes"](https://www.google.com.mx/books/edition/The_Beak_of_the_Finch/NLdZAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=the+beak+of+the+finch&printsec=frontcover)

**Follow along as we delve into this fascinating dataset, using many hand-made functions and a 'hacker' statistical approach * to explore, simulate, visualize, and ultimately study how these bird species have evolved in real time.**

* *Note: Hacker statistics is a loosely defined term that refers to a hands-on and pragmatical  approach or mindset. It emphasizes empirical distributions (i.e. ecdf), simulations, and resampling, in lieu of hypothesis testing, to work with real-world data, which is often messy and imperfect. It is best applied when assumptions about the data needed for formal statistical techniques, are not applicable.
